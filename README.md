# Nios V Example Designs Repository

This repository contains the Nios V Example designs based on different Altera FPGA development kits.

The following table contains the list of Acronyms that the user may come across in the design details

| Acronym | Expansion |
| --- | ------ |
| DMA | Direct Memory Access |
| OCM | On-Chip Memory |
| PIO | Parallel I/O |
| RTOS | Real Time Operating System |
| ECC | Error-Correcting Code |
| TCM | Tightly Coupled Memory |
| GHRD | Golden Hardware Reference Design |
| SSS | Simple Socket Server |
| CI | Custom Instrcution |
| CRC | Cyclic Redundancy Check |


There are three variants of the NiosV core:
    
    a. Nios V/m core - Microcontroller- Balanced (For interrupt driven baremetal and RTOS code)
    
    b. Nios V/g core - General-Purpose Processor- High Performance (For interrupt driven baremetal and RTOS code)

    c. Nios V/c core - Compact Microcontroller- Smallest (For non-interrupt driven baremetal code)
